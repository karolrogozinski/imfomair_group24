## Part 1a: text classification

1. In the project description, we are instructed to divide the data as 85% train, 15% test. Are we expected to perform hyperparameter tuning? If so, should we divide the data further to obtain a validation set?

2. Our code's duplication / no duplication choice is in the defult running setting in the main file. We did not implemented it in the model classes so it does not run for both dup and nodup cases once it's executed. Is this fine or do we have to change it?

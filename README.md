# Methods in AI Research 2024, group 24

## Project overview
The practical part of the course consists of a team project in which you will design, implement, evaluate and write about a restaurant recommendations dialog system using various methods from AI, such as domain modeling, text classification using machine learning and user experience testing. The project is divided into two parts. 
1. The first part of the project concerns the implementation of the dialog system: modeling the domain in a dialog model, implementing and evaluating a machine learning classifier for natural language, and developing a text-based dialog system application based on the dialog model.
2. The second part of the project is about evaluating your system: designing, carrying out and reporting on user experiments, as well as thinking about your system in the wider context of AI.

### Learning goals for Part 1:
 - Understanding and modeling a specific knowledge domain
 - Implementing and empirically evaluating a machine learning-based NLP algorithm
 - Implement a working AI system using Python
 - Writing a technical report about an AI system and its performance

### Learning goals for Part 2:
 - Designing an experiment with human participants as a way to test a hypothesis that follows from a research question
 - Conducting an experiment with human participants as a way to test a hypothesis (and experiencing the difficulty of collecting good data, and why you need to think about this hard)
 - Analyzing empirical data using statistical techniques
 - Writing a scientific report about your system's empirical evaluation and its place in AI
